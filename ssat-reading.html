This was her first time performing in front of such a large audience, and the school’s annual music contest was the event everyone talked about each spring.<br><br>
        As the announcer called her name, Samantha took a deep breath and walked onto the stage. The bright lights blinded her for a moment, but she focused on the music in her mind. She remembered her teacher’s advice: “Don’t try to be perfect. Just let the song tell its story.”<br><br>
        As she played, the notes filled the auditorium, rising and falling like a gentle river. She forgot about the judges, the audience, and even the contest itself. When the last note faded, Samantha looked up to see her classmates cheering. Whether she won or lost, she knew she had shared something special.`,

        title: "Passage 2: The Power of Photosynthesis",
        text: `Every green plant on Earth depends on photosynthesis, a process that changes sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into food. Inside each leaf, tiny structures called chloroplasts capture sunlight and use its energy to build sugars. These sugars are the plant’s food, which it uses to grow and thrive.<br><br>
        Photosynthesis not only feeds the plant but also produces oxygen, a gas all animals, including humans, need to survive. In fact, the oxygen you breathe was likely made by a plant somewhere on Earth! Without photosynthesis, life as we know it would not exist.<br><br>
        Scientists study photosynthesis not only to understand plants but also to learn how to harness the sun’s energy for human use. Solar panels, for example, are inspired by the way plants capture sunlight.`,

        title: "Passage 6: The Power of Storytelling",
        text: `Long before people had books or computers, storytelling was the way history, lessons, and traditions were shared.

        Even today, stories are an important part of life. We tell stories to teach, to entertain, and to inspire. Whether in books, movies, or conversations, storytelling brings people together and helps us make sense of our world.`,
