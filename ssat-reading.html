  Bees are vital to many ecosystems because they pollinate plants. When a bee collects nectar, pollen sticks to its body and is transferred to other flowers, allowing those plants to produce fruit and seeds. Many of the foods people eat, such as apples and almonds, rely on bees for pollination. Unfortunately, bee populations are declining due to habitat loss, pesticides, and disease. Protecting bees is important for both nature and people.`,
